For all means and purposes it works in the same way as the public registry.
it's work only for terraform v13 and later.

* pip install -r requierements.txt

Edit .env like that:
```
export go_os="linux,darwin"
export go_arch="amd64"
export gpg_public_key="-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n\nmQGNBF/j4HABDADZx5w"
export gpg_keyid="FE2DAF04078851C75465D5DA73XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export server_name="ubuntu.localdomain"
export github_repo="myorg/terraform-provider-software,jbrunetext/terraform-provider-hashicup"
export github_token="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export github_orga="myorg"

You can set server_name vars with you hostname server for your asset .You only need a apache or nginx with self signed certificate.
